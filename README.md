## This project was created for the Code Network Winter Hackathon
The story goes that you are a sous chef searching for adventure. You've grown bored by your previous experiences but are suddenly crossed with a new exciting opportunity to work as a chef on a space ship.

### Game mechanics
##### Successfully implemented:
- Slice to cut vegetables
- Vegetables must be cut at a specific angle denoted by red arrows
- Cut vegetables float in the air as if in a very low gravity space ship
- Cut vegetables can be combined
##### Yet to implement
- Finished dishes are sent off through pipes which show the intended order and a timer
- Based on if this order is correct or not, points will be awarded
